    "# Reacting to Button Presses with Asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "We already introduced one, simple way of reacting to button presses in the [main notebook](../2_board_io.ipynb). This will be enough for many applications, but it does have some restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. We can't do anything else in Python while we wait for a button to change value\n",
    "  2. We can only wait for one button at a time\n",
    "  \n",
    "If we want to listen to different buttons simultaneously or we have some background task that must be run (e.g. updating an LED pattern), we will need to use a more complex approach. We'll introduce an approach using concurrent/asynchronous programming and we won't lie... this can be **hard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are parts of this that we don't expect you to fully understand, but we will highlight the place to put in your own custom code so you can use this for your own projects. If you're particularly interested in the hairy details, please ask one of the training helpers!\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's define what we want to happen when a button is pressed and released. We'll loop forever (`while True:` does this) and write some actions for button press and release. For now, let's print a message and turn the corresponding LED on, but you could add in your own actions here too."
